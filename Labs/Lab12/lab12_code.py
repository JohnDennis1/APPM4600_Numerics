"""
 This script provides you the opprotunity play with different linear algebra solvers.
You will learn about the performance of the different solvers and how to build
test some test matrices to challenge the different methods.

#Answer to How to do QR factorization
#Take the columns of a Matrix A and apply Gram-Schmidt to the columns to get an orthogonal basis
#Then normalize each of the orthogonal basis vactors to get an orthonormal basis.
#Construct Q from the orthonormal basis vectors and then find R by multiplying Q^T with A.
#Then A = QR. so Ax = b becomes QRx = b.
#Then multiply both sides by Q^T so we get Q^TQRx = Q^Tb.
#Because Q is orthonormal, Q^TQ = I, so we have Rx = Q^Tb.
